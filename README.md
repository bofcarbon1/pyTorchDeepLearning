PyTorch Deep Learning by mrdbourke https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/
Is part of Chapter 9: Model Deployment 
A demo of Food Vision Mini 
For deployment to Hugging Faces
Contains:

fv_m_app.py a Python app that includes torch and torchvision with a Gradio demo and a ViT model.

Directories:
demos: main directory
foodvision_min: subdirectory
examples a subdirectory of foodvision_mini (this should contain images of your choice)

Additionals:
TBD a pretrained model from the chapter exercises

Note:

If you took this course Mr. D Bourke suggests using model effnetb2. 
I have chosen vit from ViT because the training and testing numbers were better for me.
This is due to environment settings with using a GPU vs a CPU in the course.

My technical environment:
Machine/OS: Mac Pro M2
GPU: 'mps' with 10-core
CPU: 10-core 
16 Core Neural Engine

Work was done in 2024 4 years after the course was created.
Pretrained models were changed over time so results from 
the original course may vary
